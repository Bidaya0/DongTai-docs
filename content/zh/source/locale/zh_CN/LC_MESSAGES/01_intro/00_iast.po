"IAST is equivalent to a combination of DAST and SAST, an interrelated "
"runtime security detection technology. It works dynamically by using an "
"agent deployed on the web application to monitor traffic sent during "
"runtime and analyzes traffic flow to identify security vulnerabilities in"
" real-time."

"**IAST tools are designed to provide greater testing accuracy, and the "
"result is clear which includes the type of vulnerability and exact "
"location in the source code of the application. It helps developers fix "
"risk in risks in real-time.**"

"There have two main types of IAST security tools which are **active "
"IAST** and **passive IAST**."

"Active IAST is the approach of combines a DAST solution (web scanner) "
"with an agent that works inside the application server.The agent will "
"validate an existing vulnerability from the value provided by web "
"scanner."

"Passive IAST also requires the instrumentation of the application with an"
" agent in the security testing environment. It will leverage any form of "
"functional testing (input, request, database,.etc.) to collect data and "
"deliver accurate security findings, so it doesnâ€™t require actively "
"running a dedicated test attack."
